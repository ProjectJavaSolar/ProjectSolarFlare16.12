    <div class="container"><h4> Jupiter (a.k.a. Jove; Greek Zeus) was the King of the Gods, the ruler of Olympus and the
        patron of the Roman state. Zeus was the son of Cronus (Saturn).
        Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus). It has been known since
        prehistoric times as a bright "wandering star". But in 1610 when Galileo first pointed a telescope at the sky he
        discovered Jupiter's four large moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto (now known as the Galilean moons) and
        recorded their motions back and forth around Jupiter. This was the first discovery of a center of motion not
        apparently centered on the Earth. It was a major point in favor of Copernicus'sheliocentric theory of the
        motions of the planets (along with other new evidence from his telescope: the phases of Venus and the mountains
        on the Moon). Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory got him in trouble with the Inquisition.
        Today anyone can repeat Galileo's observations (without fear of retribution :-) using binoculars or an
        inexpensive telescope. Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973 and later by Pioneer 11, Voyager 1,
        Voyager 2 and Ulysses. The spacecraft Galileo orbited Jupiter for eight years. It is still regularly observed by
        the Hubble Space Telescope. Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973 and later by Pioneer 11, Voyager 1,
        Voyager 2 and Ulysses. The spacecraft Galileo orbited Jupiter for eight years. It is still regularly observed by
        the Hubble Space Telescope. The gas planets do not have solid surfaces, their gaseous material simply gets
        denser with depth (the radii and diameters quoted for the planets are for levels corresponding to a pressure of
        1 atmosphere). What we see when looking at these planets is the tops of clouds high in their atmospheres
        (slightly above the 1 atmosphere level). Jupiter is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium (by numbers of atoms,
        75/25% by mass) with traces of methane, water, ammonia and "rock". This is very close to the composition of the
        primordial Solar Nebula from which the entire solar system was formed. Saturn has a similar composition, but
        Uranus and Neptune have much less hydrogen and helium. Our knowledge of the interior of Jupiter (and the other
        gas planets) is highly indirect and likely to remain so for some time. (The data from Galileo's atmospheric
        probe goes down only about 150 km below the cloud tops.) Jupiter probably has a core of rocky material amounting
        to something like 10 to 15 Earth-masses. Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid
        metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures exceeding 4
        million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Liquid metallic hydrogen consists of
        ionized protons and electrons (like the interior of the Sun but at a far lower temperature). At the temperature
        and pressure of Jupiter's interior hydrogen is a liquid, not a gas. It is an electrical conductor and the source
        of Jupiter's magnetic field. This layer probably also contains some helium and traces of various "ices". The
        outermost layer is composed primarily of ordinary molecular hydrogen and helium which is liquid in the interior
        and gaseous further out. The atmosphere we see is just the very top of this deep layer. Water, carbon dioxide,
        methane and other simple molecules are also present in tiny amounts. Recent experiments have shown that hydrogen
        does not change phase suddenly. Therefore the interiors of the Jovian planets probably have indistinct
        boundaries between their various interior layers. Three distinct layers of clouds are believed to exist
        consisting of ammonia ice, ammonium hydrosulfide and a mixture of ice and water. However, the preliminary
        results from the Galileo probe show only faint indications of clouds (one instrument seems to have detected the
        topmost layer while another may have seen the second). But the probe's entry point (left) was unusual --
        Earth-based telescopic observations and more recent observations by the Galileo orbiter suggest that the probe
        entry site may well have been one of the warmest and least cloudy areas on Jupiter at that time. Data from the
        Galileo atmospheric probe also indicate that there is much less water than expected. The expectation was that
        Jupiter's atmosphere would contain about twice the amount of oxygen (combined with the abundant hydrogen to make
        water) as the Sun. But it now appears that the actual concentration much less than the Sun's. Also surprising
        was the high temperature and density of the uppermost parts of the atmosphere. Jupiter and the other gas planets
        have high velocity winds which are confined in wide bands of latitude. The winds blow in opposite directions in
        adjacent bands. Slight chemical and temperature differences between these bands are responsible for the colored
        bands that dominate the planet's appearance. The light colored bands are called zones; the dark ones belts. The
        bands have been known for some time on Jupiter, but the complex vortices in the boundary regions between the
        bands were first seen by Voyager. The data from the Galileo probe indicate that the winds are even faster than
        expected (more than 400 mph) and extend down into as far as the probe was able to observe; they may extend down
        thousands of kilometers into the interior. Jupiter's atmosphere was also found to be quite turbulent. This
        indicates that Jupiter's winds are driven in large part by its internal heat rather than from solar input as on
        Earth. The vivid colors seen in Jupiter's clouds are probably the result of subtle chemical reactions of the
        trace elements in Jupiter's atmosphere, perhaps involving sulfur whose compounds take on a wide variety of
        colors, but the details are unknown. The colors correlate with the cloud's altitude: blue lowest, followed by
        browns and whites, with reds highest. Sometimes we see the lower layers through holes in the upper ones. The
        Great Red Spot (GRS) has been seen by Earthly observers for more than 300 years (its discovery is usually
        attributed to Cassini, or Robert Hooke in the 17th century). The GRS is an oval about 12,000 by 25,000 km, big
        enough to hold two Earths. Other smaller but similar spots have been known for decades. Infrared observations
        and the direction of its rotation indicate that the GRS is a high-pressure region whose cloud tops are
        significantly higher and colder than the surrounding regions. Similar structures have been seen on Saturn and
        Neptune. It is not known how such structures can persist for so long. Jupiter radiates more energy into space
        than it receives from the Sun. The interior of Jupiter is hot: the core is probably about 20,000 K. The heat is
        generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism, the slow gravitational compression of the planet. (Jupiter does NOT
        produce energy by nuclear fusion as in the Sun; it is much too small and hence its interior is too cool to
        ignite nuclear reactions.) This interior heat probably causes convection deep within Jupiter's liquid layers and
        is probably responsible for the complex motions we see in the cloud tops. Saturn and Neptune are similar to
        Jupiter in this respect, but oddly, Uranus is not. Jupiter is just about as large in diameter as a gas planet
        can be. If more material were to be added, it would be compressed by gravity such that the overall radius would
        increase only slightly. A star can be larger only because of its internal (nuclear) heat source. (But Jupiter
        would have to be at least 80 times more massive to become a star.) Jupiter has a huge magnetic field, much
        stronger than Earth's. Its magnetosphere extends more than 650 million km (past the orbit of Saturn!). (Note
        that Jupiter's magnetosphere is far from spherical -- it extends "only" a few million kilometers in the
        direction toward the Sun.) Jupiter's moons therefore lie within its magnetosphere, a fact which may partially
        explain some of the activity on Io. Unfortunately for future space travelers and of real concern to the
        designers of the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft, the environment near Jupiter contains high levels of energetic
        particles trapped by Jupiter's magnetic field. This "radiation" is similar to, but much more intense than, that
        found within Earth's Van Allen belts. It would be immediately fatal to an unprotected human being. The Galileo
        atmospheric probe discovered a new intense radiation belt between Jupiter's ring and the uppermost atmospheric
        layers. This new belt is approximately 10 times as strong as Earth's Van Allen radiation belts. Surprisingly,
        this new belt was also found to contain high energy helium ions of unknown origin. Jupiter has rings like
        Saturn's, but much fainter and smaller (right). They were totally unexpected and were only discovered when two
        of the Voyager 1 scientists insisted that after traveling 1 billion km it was at least worth a quick look to see
        if any rings might be present. Everyone else thought that the chance of finding anything was nil, but there they
        were. It was a major coup. They have since been imaged in the infra-red from ground-based observatories and by
        Galileo. Unlike Saturn's, Jupiter's rings are dark (albedo about .05). They're probably composed of very small
        grains of rocky material. Unlike Saturn's rings, they seem to contain no ice. Particles in Jupiter's rings
        probably don't stay there for long (due to atmospheric and magnetic drag). The Galileo spacecraft found clear
        evidence that the rings are continuously resupplied by dust formed by micro meteor impacts on the four inner
        moons, which are very energetic because of Jupiter's large gravitational field. The inner halo ring is broadened
        by interactions with Jupiter's magnetic field. In July 1994, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter with
        spectacular results (left). The effects were clearly visible even with amateur telescopes. The debris from the
        collision was visible for nearly a year afterward with HST. When it is in the nighttime sky, Jupiter is often
        the brightest "star" in the sky (it is second only to Venus, which is seldom visible in a dark sky). The four
        Galilean moons are easily visible with binoculars; a few bands and the Great Red Spot can be seen with a small
        astronomical telescope. There are several Web sites that show the current position of Jupiter (and the other
        planets) in the sky. More detailed and customized charts can be created with a planetarium program.
