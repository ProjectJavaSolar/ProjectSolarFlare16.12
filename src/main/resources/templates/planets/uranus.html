    <div class="container"><h4> Careful pronunciation may be necessary to avoid embarrassment; say "YOOR a
        nus", not "your anus" or "urine us". Uranus is the ancient Greek deity of the Heavens, the earliest supreme god.
        Uranus was the son and mate of Gaia the father of Cronus (Saturn) and of the Cyclopes and Titans (predecessors
        of the Olympian gods). Uranus, the first planet discovered in modern times, was discovered by William Herschel
        while systematically searching the sky with his telescope on March 13, 1781. It had actually been seen many
        times before but ignored as simply another star (the earliest recorded sighting was in 1690 when John Flam steed
        cataloged it as 34 Taurus). Herschel named it "the Georgian Sides" (the Georgian Planet) in honor of his patron,
        the infamous (to Americans) King George III of England; others called it "Herschel". The name "Uranus" was first
        proposed by Bode in conformity with the other planetary names from classical mythology but didn't come into
        common use until 1850.
        Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 on Jan 24 1986.
        Most of the planets spin on an axis nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic but Uranus' axis is almost
        parallel to the ecliptic. At the time of Voyager 2's passage, Uranus' south pole was pointed almost directly at
        the Sun. This results in the odd fact that Uranus' polar regions receive more energy input from the Sun than do
        its equatorial regions. Uranus is nevertheless hotter at its equator than at its poles. The mechanism underlying
        this is unknown.
        Actually, there's an ongoing battle over which of Uranus' poles is its north pole! Either its axial inclination
        is a bit over 90 degrees and its rotation is direct, or it's a bit less than 90 degrees and the rotation is
        retrograde. The problem is that you need to draw a dividing line *somewhere*, because in a case like Venus there
        is little dispute that the rotation is indeed retrograde (not a direct rotation with an inclination of nearly
        180).
        Uranus is composed primarily of rock and various ices, with only about 15% hydrogen and a little helium (in
        contrast to Jupiter and Saturn which are mostly hydrogen). Uranus (and Neptune) are in many ways similar to the
        cores of Jupiter and Saturn minus the massive liquid metallic hydrogen envelope. It appears that Uranus does not
        have a rocky core like Jupiter and Saturn but rather that its material is more or less uniformly distributed.
        Uranus' atmosphere is about 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane.
        Like the other gas planets, Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around rapidly. But they are extremely faint,
        visible only with radical image enhancement of the Voyager 2 pictures (right). Recent observations with HST
        (left) show larger and more pronounced streaks. Further HST observations show even more activity. Uranus is no
        longer the bland boring planet that Voyager saw! It now seems clear that the differences are due to seasonal
        effects since the Sun is now at a lower Uranium latitude which may cause more pronounced day/night weather
        effects. By 2007 the Sun will be directly over Uranus's equator.
        Uranus' blue color is the result of absorption of red light by methane in the upper atmosphere. There may be
        colored bands like Jupiter's but they are hidden from view by the overlaying methane layer.
        Like the other gas planets, Uranus has rings. Like Jupiter's, they are very dark but like Saturn's they are
        composed of fairly large particles ranging up to 10 meters in diameter in addition to fine dust. There are 13
        known rings, all very faint; the brightest is known as the Epsilon ring. The Uranium rings were the first after
        Saturn's to be discovered. This was of considerable importance since we now know that rings are a common feature
        of planets, not a peculiarity of Saturn alone. Voyager 2 discovered 10 small moons in addition to the 5 large
        ones already known. It is likely that there are several more tiny satellites within the rings. Uranus' magnetic
        field is odd in that it is not centered on the center of the planet and is tilted almost 60 degrees with respect
        to the axis of rotation. It is probably generated by motion at relatively shallow depths within Uranus. Uranus
        is sometimes just barely visible with the unaided eye on a very clear night; it is fairly easy to spot with
        binoculars (if you know exactly where to look). A small astronomical telescope will show a small disk. There are
        several Web sites that show the current position of Uranus (and the other planets) in the sky, but much more
        detailed charts will be required to actually find it. Such charts can be created with a planetarium program.
